### Project Description
A delightfully misleading map app that accepts any search query and always ‚Äî without fail ‚Äî takes you to a mysterious location in the middle of the ocean. With a clean UI and dramatic sarcasm, it redefines what it means to get "lost on purpose."

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are overwhelmed by too many map choices, accurate search results, and unnecessary directions. There‚Äôs a need for less efficiency, more absurdity, and exactly zero usefulness.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our app solves this fake problem by completely ignoring what users search and zooming them straight to the middle of nowhere (shhh... it‚Äôs the Bermuda Triangle üåä). We even throw in a sarcastic alert for dramatic flair.
